# Zarathustra.js

### a simple-to-use yet powerful flocking.js audio controller

Environments:

1. Drums and Midi: customize external midi keyboard settings and play notes/chords          as well as set drum patterns  
 how to use:  
  a. on the command line: 'node drums-and-midi.js',
  b. you will probably need to use the easy midi testing environment(midi-env-test.js) to get the model of your midi device and input specifications.  

2. (WIP) HTML GUI Sampler: play samples on the computer keyboard

3. (WIP) Randomyzer: an experimental sample mashup device
